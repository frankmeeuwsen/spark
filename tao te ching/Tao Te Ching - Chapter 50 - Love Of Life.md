To look for life
is to find death.
The thirteen organs of our living
are the thirteen organs of our dying.
Why are the organs of our life
where death enters us?
Because we hold too hard to living.

So I've heard
if you live in the right way,
when you cross country
you needn't fear to meet a mad bull or a tiger;
when you're in a battle
you needn't fear the weapons.
The bull would find nowhere to jab its horns,
the tiger nowhere to stick its claws,
the sword nowhere for its point to go.
Why? Because there's nowhere in you
for death to enter.
