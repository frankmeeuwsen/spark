When we don't fear what we should fear
we are in fearful danger.
We ought not to live in narrow houses,
we ought not to do stupid work.

If we don't accept stupidity
we won't act stupidly.
So, wise souls know but don't show themselves,
look after but don't prize themselves,
letting the one go, keeping the other.
